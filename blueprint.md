# Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

This project is a simple web application that generates random lottery numbers. It's built with modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following the principles of Web Components for a modular and maintainable structure.

## Implemented Features

*   **Lottery Number Generation:** Generates a set of 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45.
*   **Interactive UI:** A user-friendly interface with a button to trigger the number generation and a display area for the results.
*   **Modern Design:** Styled with modern CSS for a clean and visually appealing layout.

## Current Plan

*   **Enhance Visual Design:** Refine the styling in `style.css` to create a more premium and engaging user experience. This includes adding a background texture, improved typography with Google Fonts, realistic-looking lottery balls with gradients and shadows, and button animations.
*   **Improve User Experience:** Update `main.js` to add a subtle animation effect when the numbers are generated, making the process more interactive and exciting.
*   **Refine HTML Structure:** Add `<header>` and `<footer>` elements to `index.html` for better semantic structure and to make it feel more like a complete website.
